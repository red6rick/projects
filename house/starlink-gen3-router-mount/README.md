A wall-mount for the Starlink Gen3 router.

This was designed to hold the new Starlink Gen3 router specifically for
use in my RV.

The mount is implemented as two wall-mounted clips to hold the router
with the base perpendicular to the wall (just like on a tabletop (if your
walls are vertical!)). The router is far enough from the wall to allow
the cabling to come from above or below and turn into the router body.

The router will snap into and out of the clips easily to allow access
to the cable connections when needed.

Printed in ABS for temperature resistance.
