Accessories and storage solutions for Flagpole Buddy.

Flagpole Buddy produces a mount for Starlink dishes (aka, pizza boxes) for
RV use. RVs have a tremendous lack of storage, so I designed a wall-mounted
hook for the pole set and a wall-mounted cradle for the suction cup pole
mounts. This gets both of them off the floor and into a more manageable place.

The actual mount for the Starlink dish clips onto the dish itself in a
relatively permanent way, then snaps onto the top of the pole. Sometimes there
isn't a view of the sky above any spot on the RV where the pole can be mounted.
The ground stand lets the dish be placed anywhere you want without having to
disconnect the top-of-pole mount from it.
